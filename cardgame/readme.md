# Card Game

Design the set of classes and interfaces that you would need to implement the functionality of a generic card game, including method signatures and member variables.

Create a new deck: const deck = new Deck();

## Methods: 

* Create deck: deck.createDeck(numberOfDeckToCreate)
* Shuffle: deck.shuffle(numberOfTimeToShuffleDeck)
* Draw random card: deck.drawRandom()
* Draw x number of card from top of the deck: deck.draw(5)
* Display total number of cards: deck.count
